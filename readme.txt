ex00:
    Each assignment follow the same structure, you have to create a directory, go to the directory (cd) and work on your assignment.
ex01:
    Create a file called my_first_file_with_content in your directory. Update its size.
    Size needs to be: 40.
ex02:
    Create a file called my_first_file_with_content_and_perms in your directory. Update its size THEN its permissions. (in this order: because you will be asked to remove the permission to WRITE to a file which will be problematic to add a content inside it ;-))
    Size needs to be: 40 (be creative, here, how a file can have a size of 40...? :))
    Permissions need to be: r--r-xr-x (Google chmod? :-))
ex04:
    Create a file called my_z that returns "Z", followed by a new line, whenever the command cat is used on it.
